2. Title of the Experiment
Develop an Interactive SVG Drawing Tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

3. Defined Approach
In this experiment, an interactive SVG Drawing Tool was developed using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

An SVG canvas was used as the drawing area where users can draw freehand scribbles using the mouse.
Mouse events such as mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup were handled using JavaScript to enable real-time drawing.

The drawing follows the mouse pointer accurately by converting screen coordinates into SVG coordinates.
An Undo button was implemented to remove the last drawn shape, and a Reset button was provided to clear the entire drawing area.

A counter was also included to display the total number of shapes drawn.
External CSS was used for styling to keep the interface clean, simple, and beginner-friendly.

Only the required features were implemented as per the experiment instructions.
